# FreeIPA Community Portal #

The FreeIPA Community Portal is a web application that acts as a portal through
which anonymous users can interact with a FreeIPA server for purposes such as
self-service registration.

A complete overview of the rationale and architecture of the Community Portal
can be found at http://www.freeipa.org/page/V4/Community_Portal
